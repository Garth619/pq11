							<p>Our client lost his driver’s license after two drinking and driving offenses and three minor in possession alcohol offenses. He had not had a driver’s license for approximately seven years. Initially, we were able to obtain a restricted license for our client, but the Secretary of State denied a full license because he had a Michigan Medical Marijuana Act card and had used medical marijuana in the past -even though he no longer used marijuana. After appealing the Secretary of State Hearing Officer’s decision to the 30th Circuit Court, the Circuit Court granted our client a full driver’s license because the Hearing Officer’s decision violated the Michigan Medical Marijuana Act.</p>
